## About Blackjack

Blackjack is a popular American casino game, now found throughout the world. It is a banking game in which the aim of the player is to achieve a hand whose points total nearer to 21 than the banker's hand, but without exceeding 21.


## Game Objective

The Alexa skill is played according to the Blackjack rules posted at : https://www.pagat.com/banking/blackjack.html

- The Deal and "Blackjack"
	At the start of the blackjack game, the player and the dealer receive two cards each. The players' cards are dealt face up, while the dealer has one face down and one face up.

	The best possible blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace with any ten-point card. This is called a "blackjack", or a natural 21, and the player holding this automatically wins unless the dealer also has a blackjack. If a player and the dealer each have a blackjack, the result is a push for that player. If the dealer has a blackjack, all players not holding a blackjack lose.

- The Players' turns

	The player can keep his hand as it is and fold or take more cards from the deck (hit), one at a time, until either the player judges that the hand is strong enough to go up against the dealer's hand and stands, or until it goes over 21, in which case the player immediately loses (busts).


- The Dealer's turn

	When the players have finished their actions, either decided to fold or busted, the dealer turns over his hidden hole card.

	If the dealer has a natural 21 (blackjack) with his two cards, he won't take any more cards. All players lose, except players who also have a blackjack, in which case it is a push - the bet is returned to the player.

	If the dealer doesn't have a natural, he hits (takes more cards) or stands depending on the value of the hand. Contrary to the player, though, the dealer's action is completely dictated by the rules. The dealer must hit if the value of the hand is lower than 17, otherwise the dealer will stand.
